# SpyderOS

SpyderOS is a easy to use "operating system". It can complete math calculations, generate random numbers and keep track of things. The code will be officially released once that version number is complete (eg. version 1.2 (includes 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and so on) will be released when work begins on 1.3)
